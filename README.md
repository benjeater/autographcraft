## Description

AutoGraphCraft can generate an entire GraphQL API from GraphQL schema files, including the resolver functions, authorisation logic, entity relationships, database schema and typescript types.

### Features

- **Best Practices**: AutoGraphCraft follows best practices for GraphQL and database design
- **Type Generation**: AutoGraphCraft will generate the typescript types for the schema files, including the types for the resolvers and context
- **Resolver Generation**: AutoGraphCraft will generate the entire GraphQL API from the schema files, including the resolvers, types, and context.
- **Customisable**: The generated output can be customised by adding additional custom resolver
- **Database Agnostic**: The resolvers can be generated for the database you are using by installing the appropriate resolver package
- **Type Safe**: The generated types are fully typed and can be used in your application to ensure type safety
- **Relationships**: The resolvers can be generated to include relationships between entities
- **Authentication**: Allow/Disallow access to data/entites based on the caller's permissions

## Install

The AutoGraphCraft requires two packages to be installed; the generation package and a resolver package.

The generate package is only required as part of your build process, so should be installed as a dev dependency:

```sh
npm install @autographcraft/generate --save-dev
```

Then you will need to install a resolver package. This package will be used to resolve the data from your database. The resolver package should be installed as a regular dependency:

```sh
npm install @autographcraft/[package-name]
```

For instance, if you wanted to use MongoDB as your database, you would install the MongoDB package by running:

```sh
npm install @autographcraft/mongodb
```

## Setup

### Initialise the Package

The package needs to be initalised before it is first run, otherwise it will not be able to generate any output. The initialisation will perform two steps:

1. Add the `autographcraft.config.js` file to the root of your project
2. Add additional configuration to your `gitignore` file

The configuration file will specify where the source and target directories are for the generation process. Each of these options is detailed in the [Configuration Readme](./README-CONFIGURATION.md).

The initialisation is a guided process to create the configuration which can be called with:

```sh
npx autographcraft init
```

If you wish to initialise with the default settings, use:

```sh
npx autographcraft init --default
```

### Implement the Package

Add the following script to your `package.json` file:

```json
"scripts": {
  "generate": "npx autographcraft generate"
}
```

If you wish to have the types generated on every build (recommended), add `generate` to the `prebuild` script:

```json
"scripts": {
  "prebuild": "npm run generate",
  "generate": "npx autographcraft generate"
}
```

### Update Configuration

The configuration should be updated via the `config set` command. Further details can be found in the [Configuration Readme](./README-CONFIGURATION.md).

## Usage

### Specifying the Schema

In order to generate the types, you will need to specify the schema. This is done by creating `.graphql` files in the `schemaSourceDirectory` directory specified in the `autographcraft.config.js` file.

A standard schema file for a user might look like:

```graphql
type User @model {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  email: String!
}
```

The `@model` directive on the `User` type is used to specify that this type should be used to generate resolvers. The `id` field is required and should be of type `ID!`.  All other fields are optional.

Models can be connected to other models by specifying a field as a type of another model.  In the example below, a `User` can have many `Post`s and a `Post` can have one `User`:

```graphql
type User @model {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  email: String!
  posts: [Post] @hasMany(targetIndexName: "byCreatedByUserId")
}

type Post @model {
  id: ID!
  createdByUserId: ID! @index(name: "byCreatedByUserId")
  user: User @hasOne(idField: "createdByUserId")
  title: String!
  content: String!
}
```

Further information on how to define schemas can be found in the [Schema Readme](./README-SCHEMA.md).

### Implementing the Generated Output

The generated files includes the resolvers, typedefs, and context generation for a GraphQL server.  The resolvers have been tested with [Apollo Server](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server) and [GraphQL Yoga](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/yoga-server), but should work with most GraphQL servers.

The resolvers can be found in the directory specified by the `generatedTypesDirectory` in the `autographcraft.config.js` file and can be imported using the default export:

```typescript
import resolvers from './generatedTypes/resolvers'
```

The typedefs can be found in the directory specified by the `generatedTypesDirectory` in the `autographcraft.config.js` file and can be imported using the `loadFiles` utility from `@graphql-tools/load-files`:

```typescript
import { loadFiles } from "@graphql-tools/load-files";
const typeDefs = await loadFiles("src/generatedTypes/typeDefs.graphql");
```

These can then be combined to create the schema for the GraphQL server:

```typescript
import { ApolloServer } from 'apollo-server';
import { makeExecutableSchema } from '@graphql-tools/schema';
import { loadFiles } from '@graphql-tools/load-files';
import resolvers from './generatedTypes/resolvers';

const typeDefs = await loadFiles('src/generatedTypes/typeDefs.graphql');

const schema = makeExecutableSchema({
  typeDefs,
  resolvers,
});
```

The context can be generated using the `createAutoGraphCraftContext` function from the `generatedUtilsDirectory` in the `autographcraft.config.js` file:

```typescript
import { createAutoGraphCraftContext } from './generatedTypes/utils';

const context = async (initialContext) => {
  // Create the context required for the resolvers
  const autographcraftContext = await createAutoGraphCraftContext(
    autoGraphCraftContextParams,
  );
  
  // Combine the initial context with the autographcraft context
  const context = {
    ...initialContext,
    ...autographcraftContext,
  };
  return context;
};
```

An example of how to implement the resolvers with GraphQL Yoga can be found in the [Examples](./examples) directory.

### Custom Resolvers

Some queries and mutations may require custom resolvers because a functionality is required that does not fit within the CRUDL architecture; using the example from the previous section, there may be a requirement to count the number of posts that a user has made.

To create a new custom query or custom mutation, create a new `.graphql` file in the `schemaSourceDirectory` directory.  The file should contain the `Query` or `Mutation` type:

```graphql
type Query {
  countPostsByUser(userId: ID!): Int!
}

type Mutation {
  deleteAllPostsByUser(userId: ID!): [Post]
}
```

Multiple `type Query` and `type Mutation` types can be defined in the `schemaSourceDirectory` directory files and will be combined into the final schema.

The custom resolvers will be created based on each query and mutation, and will be placed in the `queriesDirectory` directory or the `mutationsDirectory` directory from the `autographcraft.config.js` file.  The custom queries and mutations will already be imported into the resolvers file, so they can be used without any modification to the GraphQL server.

Each of the custom resolvers will be typed based on the schema.  You can then implement the required logic in the custom resolver.
